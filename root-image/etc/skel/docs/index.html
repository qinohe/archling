<h3>Welcome.</h3></p>


<br>So you installed archiso and/or made this ISO with it, and it's running, nice! 
<br>
<br>If you found this as ISO on the internet, it's not mine, you should not trust it as mine, that said
<br>
<br>There is a lot of software on this build, I won't go trough them, as I think you know how to find them.
<br>
<br>A few configs and scripts are opened up, with Geany, already, so you check or change them for this session.
<br>
<br>If you are familiar with I3WM, just take a look at keybinds.txt tab, in Geany, for the extra keybinds.
<br>
<br>In the case, you are not in any way familiar with i3WM, or tilling, I suggest to first read the i3WM manual.
<br>
<br>The i3WM guide is available on the tab dwb has opened, next to 'this' one.
<br>
<br>Ranger (file manager) and mc (Midnight Commander) are opened as tabs on workspace 1:explore
<br>
<br>Enjoy ;)
<br>
<br>
<br>Special thanks go to my family and my pal Erwin, how had to bare with all my talks about this build, thanks man.
<br>
<br>Thank you Michael (i3WM.org) for making i3WM possible and for allowing me to use the offline HTML, i3WM user guide on this build.
<br>
<br>Thank you devs, who created all application software used on this build.
<br>
<br>Of course all devs from the Arch Linux project who made this whole project possible in the first place, and all people on the Arch board that helped in any way.
<br>
<br>Thank you Arch Trademark team, for allowing me to use the name 'archling' for this build, you can never be sure enough;)
