extra keybinds
--------------

Check i3wm config file, next to this tab.

* By default there is no menu, only dmenu, which is created dynamically.
However, there is xfce4-panel on this build, for people how can't live without a panel.
Xfce4-panel is created dynamic,  but not enabled on system start.
execute xfce4-panel 
mod4+x                  executes xfce4-panel
kill xfce4-panel
mod4+Shift+x        kills xfce4-panel -q

* Cycle trough layouts, change container layout (stacked, tabbed, toggle split) Trilby made this ;) 
mod4+z                   opens script /home/$USER/.i3/scripts/switch-layout


* Next keybinds gets you into the "brows" mode  'mod4+b, which is the Windows  key, if you have it, otherwise change it before you build it next time;), 
after you hit 'mod4+b' a window opens with the urgency hint set, which means no more then waiting for input from you.
If you after that type one of the letters below, dwb will open and/or that page for you.
	 a                opens or adds  https://archlinux.org, 
	 b                opens or adds  https://bugs.archlinux.org, 
	 d                opens or adds  https://duckduckgo.com, 
	 f                opens or adds  https://bbs.archlinux.org, 
	 g                opens or adds  http://google.com, 
	 i                opens or adds  http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html, 
	 k                opens or adds  https://www.kernel.org/, 
	 l                opens or adds  https://linux.org, 
	 o                opens or adds  https://openvz.org, 
	 r                opens or adds  http://reddit.com, 
	 s                opens or adds  http://slashdot.org, 
	 y                opens or adds  https://youtube.com, 
	 w                opens or adds  https://wiki.archlinux.org, 

Dwb will open on workspace 1:explore, as that is predefined in the config.

*Next the “tray” mode, which will open, or pkill a tray program.
By default, no tray programs are opened.
The procedure is the same as with the brows mode. So I only add the commands here.
$mod+t  enter the tray mode
         b                blueman-applet
    	 Shift+b          pkill blueman-applet
    	 n                /usr/bin/nm-applet --sm-disable
    	 Shift+n          pkill nm-applet



# exit i3, with dmenu logout/reboot/poweroff Mr.Green(archbang) made this.is far as know.
mod4+Shift+t exec /home/$USER/.i3/scripts/power
